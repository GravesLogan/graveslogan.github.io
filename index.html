        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I am Logan Graves, an enthusiastic and detail-oriented Computer Scientist. I graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2025 with a bachelors degree 
            in Computer Science. I have a passion for coding and problem solving, and I am always looking for new challenges to tackle.<br>
            I have experience in working by myself as well as within  a group environment, one of such cases where I led as the project manager for a year for my senior capstone project.<br>
            I strive to hone my skills by working on a variety of projects as well as expand my knowledge by completing online courses and certifications.
            Some of these such projects can be found in the Projects section of this portfolio. <br>
